	<p>Land cover over the subwatersheds containing the three study lakes in my M.S. project, as a way to determine level of urbanization, which in turn influenced the microbial communities of the lakes. I reclassified the land use types into simpler categories for ease of analysis and to make the three time points comparable since they didn't have the exact same original categories. I produced this for my Introduction to GIS class. Made with ArcMap 10.4. Projected using the NAD 1983 Hotine Oblique Mercator Azimuth Natural Origin projection system. The 1800 and 1978 land cover data were taken from the State of Michigan, and the 2011 land cover data was taken from the National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD 2011). The subwatershed boundaries are the 12-digit HUC level (State of Michigan).</p>

	<p>Spatial context of the three subwatersheds in the land cover map above within their respective counties. I produced this for my Introduction to GIS class. Made with ArcMap 10.4. Projected using the NAD 1983 Hotine Oblique Mercator Azimuth Natural Origin projection system. The county boundaries and subwatershed boundaries were taken from the State of Michigan. The subwatershed boundaries are the 12-digit HUC level (State of Michigan).</p>
