    <p id="about-me">I'm an aquatic microbial ecologist with experience in field work in all types of weather (including Michigan winters), lab work, and data analysis. I graduated as a Master of Science in 2018 from the Department of Biological Sciences at Western Michigan University. I enjoy finding out what microbes are present in a given community and what drives differences between communities. I have experience with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, QIIME2, and R (especially the packages phyloseq, ggplot2, and vegan). I also do nucleic acid extractions, PCR and qPCR, cell culturing, and media preparation.

    I especially enjoy anything with a visual output, such as microscopy, GIS analyses, and data visualizations. I also like designing organization systems both for data on the computer and for samples and lab supplies. I am very detail-oriented during manuscript preparation and while doing data entry. I have experience as a teaching assistant and in training multiple new hires at once. I'm currently a research technologist at the University of Chicago.</p>
